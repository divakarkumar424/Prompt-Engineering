# Prompt-Engineering
Prompt engineering involves crafting prompts that empower AI models to generate responses based on provided inputs. It is the intelligent construction of prompts for text-based AI tasks, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). These prompts play a crucial role in guiding both the user and the model to produce specific outputs as needed. By effectively incorporating requirements into prompts, this process facilitates desired outcomes, thus earning the term "Prompt Engineering."
